  %p.mbl
    Object is a simple component that is used across the project. You 
    can't place any other object inside of it because it is indivisible.
    Create objects to build more complex modules with them.

  %p.mbl
    Let's say you have 3 sizes and 3 colors of a button. In this case its 
    better to write <code>.button</code> as an object name and create 
    modifiers keeping separate structure from skin.

  %p
    Modifier name should start with a prefix <code>.is-</code> and means a 
    logical state of the object or module. Note that class name that starts 
    with this prefix is reserved for modifiers only. Don't use such 
    convention for the object name.

  %pre<
    %code<
      :preserve
        .button
        .button.is-tiny /* Defines shape and size */
        .button.is-positive /* Defines color */

  %p.mbl
    You can move similar objects to a group â€” a separate stylesheet where you store all modifiers
    of the current class.

  %p
    Object should fit a whole available space of the grid it is placed in.
    It will help to reuse this object in other locations.
